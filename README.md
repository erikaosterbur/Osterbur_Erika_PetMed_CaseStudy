##Issue
Itâ€™s difficult to keep track of all the important information you need for your pet(s)!

##Solution
Create an app where users can easily create and store information they need for their pet(s).

##User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to add my pet to a database and include descriptive information about them so that I can keep track of their information.
* As a user, I want to record every vet visit they have so that I can manage their health history.
* As an admin, I want to add veterinarians to the database so that users have a list to choose from.
